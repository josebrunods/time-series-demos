# papermill-demo

This demo shows how to use
[papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill) to execute Jupyter
notebooks. Here we use it to generate two-tailed constant threshold
anomaly detectors for white noise time series, running various data
pipeline steps along the way.

To run,

```
$ python3 train-ct.py
```
